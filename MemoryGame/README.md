# Memory Game Project

## Instructions

This is a memory game. Clicking the tiles will reveal icons. If two icons (which are open) match, then these cards will remain open. If they do not match, the tiles will be reversed again.

There is a stars rating present which will be provided upon completing the game. This is dependant on the number of moves to complete the game. The rating is as such:
* **1-10 moves:** 3 stars.
* **11-20 moves:** 2 stars.
* **21-30 moves:** 1 star.
* **30+ moves:** 0 star.

To win this game, all tiles should be matched.
