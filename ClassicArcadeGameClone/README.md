# Classic Arcade Game Clone

## Instructions

This is a classic arcade game clone of the game [Frogger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frogger).

The control of this game is up, down, left and right keyboard keys.

The character has to get through to the stepping stone on the top water row. Crashing into the enemies on the road or going into the water will reduce the characters life. There is a limit of 5 lives. Once the character reaches the stepping stone, the level increases. This will make the enemy speed up. To win the game, reach the stepping stone across all 10 levels.
